# Install Splunk Enterprise as the SIEM Server

## Introduction
This document explains how to install **Splunk Enterprise** and set it up as a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) server. Splunk Enterprise will act as the central place where logs from different machines (Windows/Linux) are collected, stored, and analyzed.

---

## Overview
- Splunk Enterprise is the **main SIEM server** in our lab setup.  
- It receives logs from clients using the **Splunk Universal Forwarder (UF)**.  
- Once installed, we can use the Splunk Web interface to search, analyze, and visualize logs.  
- This is the **first and most important step** in building a log monitoring and security lab.

## What is Splunk Enterprise? (Simple)
Think of **Splunk Enterprise** like a **big smart mailbox**:
- Logs from different computers are like letters.  
- The mailbox (Splunk) collects all the letters in one place.  
- You can then search, organize, and understand whatâ€™s happening on your systems.

## Purpose
The purpose of installing Splunk Enterprise is to:
- Create a **central log management system**.  
- Enable **real-time monitoring and searching** of logs.  
- Build a foundation for learning **SIEM concepts and blue team skills**.  
- Prepare the server so Linux and Windows clients can send their logs to it.
